This section covers all the settings-related commands that Zero Munge can perform.

- **Set Game Path...** – Opens a prompt to point Zero Munge to Battlefront's GameData directory. This is used as a base to help determine where LVL files should be copied to after munging.
- **Preferences** – Opens the Preferences window, from which you can change various application settings such as checking for updates or showing the update prompt on startup, file list auto-save and auto-load, etc.
