<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>The goal of this tool is to act as a robust replacement for VisualMunge (the automation tool provided with the SWBF2 mod tools).  </p>
<p>It is written in Visual C# for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718">.NET Framework 4</a>.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>At its core, this tool goes through a user-specified list of munge.bat files and executes each one after the previous is finished.  </p>
<p>This tool can be used to do the following things. Completed features are <strong>bolded</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execute a list of batch files in order</strong></li>
<li><strong>Toggle whether or not certain files will be executed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Log each file's output in real-time (with timestamps) to a log window and log file</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clear the contents of the output log / copy its contents to the clipboard / save its contents to a file</strong></li>
<li><strong>Auto-detect the munge.bat file inside a selected folder and add it to the file list</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add the common munge.bat files for an entire project to the file list</strong></li>
<li><strong>For each file, copy the associated LVL file(s) to another directory</strong></li>
<li>Save and load different &quot;presets&quot; of the file list's contents and toggle values</li>
</ul>
