## What it is
The goal of Zero Munge is to act as a robust replacement for VisualMunge (the automation tool provided with the SWBF2 mod tools).  

It is written in Visual C# for [.NET Framework 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718).

## What it does
At its core, Zero Munge goes through a user-specified list of munge.bat files and executes each one at a time.  

Zero Munge can be used to do the following things:

* Execute a list of batch files in order
* Toggle whether or not certain files will be executed
* Log each file's output in real-time (with timestamps) to a log window and log file
* Auto-detect the munge.bat file inside a selected folder and add it to the file list
* Add typical munge.bat files (common, sides, world, etc.) for an entire project to the file list
* For each file, copy the associated LVL file(s) to another directory
* Save and load different "presets" of the file list's contents
* Ability to check for updates and point user to latest release's download page
