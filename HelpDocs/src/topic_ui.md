- [**File List**](topic_ui_filelist.html) – The File List drives the core functionality of Zero Munge. It contains a list of files to execute, the order in which to execute them, where to copy munged files, which munged files to copy, and so on.
- **Actions** – The buttons in the Actions list perform various commands that relate to the File List. All of these commands can also be found in the [**Actions menu**](topic_menu_actions.html).
- **Output Log** – The controls in this section pertain to the Output Log, which displays output from Zero Munge as well as the processed files' text output in real-time.
